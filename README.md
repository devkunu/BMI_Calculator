# WEB DEV WITH NODEJS
Hi I made this project BMI CALCULATOR during the training period, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. <br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

  <br>l got to have hands on experience on:
<li>HTML
<li>JavaScript
<li>Node.js
<li>Express.js
<br>during these days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can leam. I enjoyed these days, you can as well. To register for next free trainings, visit:
